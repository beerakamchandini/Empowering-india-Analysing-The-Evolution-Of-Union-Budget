Empowering India: Analysing the Evolution of Union Budget Allocations for Sustainable Growth
Abstract

This project analyzes India’s Union Budget allocations from FY 2021–22 to FY 2023–24 to understand government spending priorities and their role in sustainable economic growth. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and processed using Python for cleaning, transformation, and aggregation. Interactive dashboards and story visualizations were developed in Tableau to present sector-wise, ministry-wise, and yearly budget trends. A simple forecasting approach was applied to estimate future sector allocations. The analysis highlights key investment areas and provides data-driven insights into India’s fiscal strategy.

1. Introduction

India’s Union Budget reflects the government’s economic priorities and development agenda. Analyzing budget allocation patterns helps identify focus sectors, spending concentration, and growth direction. This project aims to transform raw budget data into meaningful insights using data analytics and visualization techniques.
